# hogsvd
Experimental Matlab implementation of the Higher-Order Generalized Singular Value (HO-GSVD) Decomposition. The implementation is based on the paper
"A Higher-Order Generalized Singular Value Decomposition for Rank Deficient Matrices" by Idris Kempf, Paul J. Goulart and Stephen R. Duncan. A pre-print
of the paper can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09822.

If you use the HO-GSVD for published work, we encourage you to cite the accompanying paper.
